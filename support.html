    The etymology is lost in time. The Romanian word mârșă,[2] meaning "lure" or "bait", has probably nothing to do with the name origin.
According to 1901 edition of Marele Dicționar Geografic al Romîniei (English: Great Romanian Geographical Dictionary),Mârșa was in the 19th century
a rural commune located on Drîmbovnic (nowadays Dâmbovnic) Valley, part of Neajlov District (Plasa Neajlov), Vlașca County. Also, former property o
f Bolintineanu family - the poet Dumitru Bolintineanu (a.k.a. Dimitrie Bolintineanu) being even born in there, Mârșa (Mîrșia) was later divided
between Mîrșia-din-Deal (en: Mîrșia-On-the-Hill), property of R. Dumitriu (later dowry to C. Nacu) and Mîrșia-din-Vale (en: Mîrșia-On-the-V
alley), property of Nicolae Cioflic (Note: interpreted from original record[3]).
